        <p>Damian Marley is the youngest son of reggae musician
            Bob Marley.[2] He is the only child born to Marley and
            Cindy Breakspeare, a Jamaican jazz singer and crowned
            Miss World 1976. Like several of Bob Marley’s children,
            Damian was born out of wedlock and outside of Bob’s
            marriage to singer Rita Marley.[3]
            After seeing the movie Damien: Omen II,
            which is about the coming of the Antichrist,
            one of Bob's last requests in Germany was to have
            Damian's name changed. "Damien being a devil...
            It was inappropriate for him as a Rastafarian
            to have a child with that name," Bob said and
            Damian's name was later changed.[4]</p>
        <p>Damian was two years old when his father died.
            His nickname "Junior Gong" is derived from his
            father's nickname of "Tuff Gong".</p>
